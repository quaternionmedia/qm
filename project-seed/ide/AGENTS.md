<!-- SEED FILE: this whole project-seed/ide/ directory mirrors the target
     project's own root layout 1:1 -- copy it recursively onto the project
     root (handbook/forking-a-project.md, step 5) rather than copying files
     one at a time. CLAUDE.md and .github/copilot-
     instructions.md are real symlinks to this file in the seed; a
     symlink-preserving copy (git checkout, `cp -a`/`cp -P`, `rsync -a`)
     carries that forward so an edit to this file alone keeps both current.
     Delete this comment in the copy. Replace every <name> placeholder with
     the project's own name, and fill in project-specific setup and test
     commands below the marked line. The governance section above that line
     is otherwise left untouched: a placeholder is meant to be replaced, and
     a live project file carrying a literal <name> sends its reader to a
     branch that does not exist. -->
# AGENTS.md

This project is governed by the Quaternion Media constitution, vendored at
`governance/qm` (a submodule pinned to this project's `project/<name>`
branch of that repo). If you are an AI coding agent opening this repo with
no other briefing, read this file fully before your first commit or edit.

## Before you do anything

**Establish four facts about this session before you write anything**, by
asking the repository rather than inheriting a previous session's belief:

1. **The commit you are working against**, and the branch.
2. **Which pull requests you already hold open, and how they stack** — small,
   atomic pull requests, a dependent one stacked on its parent as a draft:
   `python governance/qm/project-seed/ci/check_one_pr.py --repo <owner/name>`.
3. **What else is in flight in this clone** — a dirty tree you did not dirty, a
   sibling branch, an unpushed commit. Other sessions are likely running right
   now, in other repositories, for the same reviewer;
   `governance/qm/handbook/async-contract.md` is the short set of rules for
   working alongside them.
4. **Which gates exist**, and what each cannot see:
   `python governance/qm/project-seed/ci/run_workflows_locally.py`.

Those are the invariants. **How** you gather them is yours to choose — read the
repository, run the scripts above, or use an adapter if one exists for your
tooling. `governance/qm/adapters/` holds any that do, each named for the product
it targets and none of them required. This file names no vendor, and neither
should anything you add to it.

**Read the corpus's committed status documents before re-deriving what they
hold.** `governance/qm/status/harness.yaml` and
`governance/qm/status/governance.yaml` each carry their own refresh command and
staleness budget in a `reading:` block inside the file. Check the age before
quoting a figure.

1. Read `governance/qm/PRINCIPLES.md` in full and the opening points of `governance/qm/README.md`. For namespaces and precedence, see `governance/qm/docs/ref/namespaces.md` and `governance/qm/docs/ref/precedence.md`.
2. This project's own decision records live in `governance/qm/adr/` — inside
   the submodule, on this project's own branch, not at this repo's root — as
   `ADR-NNNN` (numbered locally, at ratification) or `DRAFT-*.md` before
   ratification. A human ratifies; you draft.
3. **Everything you produce arrives as a pull request, and the pull request is
   an audit record rather than a request for anyone's attention.** Work on a
   branch and open a PR — in this repo, and in the `governance/qm` submodule
   when you touch this project's records there — then **merge it yourself once
   every gate is green.** Your job is a default branch that is clean and
   working, entered through a pull request so the gates ran and the diff stays
   readable afterwards. **Never push a shared branch directly**: that is the
   one act that destroys the audit record.
   **The default branch is not a claim, so merging into it is not a release.**
   Per `governance/qm/records/DRAFT-version-tags-are-claims.md` §4, the default
   branch, a pull request and a local build are all drafts — they may be
   perfectly good and they assert nothing. **The two human gates are
   ratification, for what a record says, and the version tag, for what this
   project ships.** A `v*` tag asserts a human reviewed the change set, a human
   manually tested it against its real runtime, and deterministic automated
   validation passed. Keeping the default branch clean is what makes cutting
   one cheap.
   **Never request a review**, and add the person who asked for the work as
   **assignee**. Reviewers are named at the tag, by the human cutting it. A
   review request pulls a second person into work that asserts nothing yet, and
   against a branch carrying a live `CODEOWNERS` it fires the moment the PR
   opens — you name no one, and the notification cannot be recalled.
   **Draft means unfinished, or stacked on an open PR, and nothing else.** It
   is not a holding pen for finished work: a green PR left in draft against
   the default branch is a change that never landed.
   **One change per PR; parallel when independent, stacked when dependent.**
   Two changes that could land alone are two PRs, each ready against its base.
   A PR that needs another's work is cut from that branch, targets it as its
   base, and stays a draft until the one beneath it merges, however finished
   it is. When it does, retarget the next PR onto the target *before*
   deleting the merged branch — deleting it first closes every PR based on
   it. Never close a PR in favour of one that contains it
   (`governance/qm/handbook/async-contract.md` §1).
   `.github/workflows/one-pr-check.yml` refuses a ready stacked PR; run
   `governance/qm/project-seed/ci/check_one_pr.py` before you open anything.
   One active stack at a time is the habit to aim for, never a limit.
   **The pull request body speaks as the contributor, to the world.** It is
   posted under a human's account and addresses nobody — a question or a
   handling instruction for the person who asked belongs in the session,
   never in the body (`governance/qm/handbook/async-contract.md` §3;
   `check_pr_voice.py` refuses the second person).
4. **Human-only contributorship applies to every commit you make here** (see
   `governance/qm/records/DRAFT-human-only-contributorship.md`): do not add
   yourself, your model name, or any co-author trailer naming an unmonitored
   address (e.g. a vendor `noreply@` address) to any commit. If your default
   tooling normally appends a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer, suppress it for
   this repo. Tool involvement is disclosed as a `Tools:` note where the
   artifact calls for one, never as a byline.
5. Follow the drafting-session handoff contract in
   `governance/qm/adr/README.md` before writing or amending any record.
6. A QM record may be tightened by this project's own records, never
   relaxed — see `governance/qm/docs/ref/precedence.md`.
7. **Put explanation in one place**, per
   `governance/qm/handbook/style-guide.md`: inline comments carry clarifying
   facts about the code, `README.md` is a shallow onramp to the docs, `docs/`
   is reference, and **every why goes to a retrospective in
   `governance/qm/perspectives/`**. A record's Context and Alternatives are
   the one exception, answering *why this decision* rather than *why it went
   that way*.
8. Banned in any pre-ratification `DRAFT-*.md` record: "previously",
   "originally", "earlier draft", "re-review", "renumber", "retroactive",
   "supersedes the ... (stance|finding)", "corrected". Drafts are rewritten
   in place, not narrated. The ADR lint enforces this over prose only, so
   quoting the list in a code span is fine.
9. **Establish a fact before asserting it, and check a signal before reading
   it.** A claim that something is broken, unsupported or behaves a certain way
   carries the command you ran and what it returned. Before reporting what a
   result means, name one other thing that would produce the same output — a
   tool version, a flag's semantics, stale local state, the working directory,
   a substring matching prose. An unexpected uniform result is a tooling fault
   until shown otherwise, and a check that has only ever been seen green has
   not been tested: break the thing it names and watch it go red.
10. **A claim about what facts *mean* names what else could produce them.**
    This is the sibling of the rule above and catches a different failure: the
    facts are all true and the sentence built from them is wrong. Name the
    ordinary cause before the interesting one — same author, same source, same
    tooling, same period — and state direction and date, because "A resembles
    B" is symmetric and the useful version rarely is. **A correction carries
    the same burden as the claim it replaces**: an overclaim gets caught by a
    reader who knows better, while a deflation reads as rigour, closes the
    topic, and can quietly delete something real. See
    `governance/qm/records/DRAFT-decision-record-discipline.md` §7 and §8.
11. **The scaffolding you measure with is part of the measurement.** Item 9 is
    the tool answering a different question than you asked. This is the tool
    being fine and the setup not — nothing errors, and the result describes your
    own scaffolding rather than the subject. Its shapes: a diff against files a
    redirect never wrote; a working tree read after a merge that exited
    non-zero; file copies written through a text API that converts every line
    ending, so the diff is all encoding; a mutation test whose baseline is
    already failing, so it proves nothing either way. **Prefer the artefact you
    did not create** — read a document's own answer instead of recomputing one —
    and assert the intermediate: non-empty, exit zero, baseline green.
12. **A guard is not finished until someone has tried to route around it.**
    Breaking it and watching it go red proves it fires on the case you thought
    of; it cannot find the case you did not. Ask for a pass whose brief is to
    satisfy the check while doing the thing it forbids. A guard with a hole is
    worse than no guard — it is a green check standing exactly where a reader
    believes something is enforced. See the same record's §9 and §10.

13. **Show it by running it** — `show-it-by-running-it` of the charter, with
    `governance/qm/records/DRAFT-one-executable-walkthrough.md` as the record.
    This project's `walkthrough/` is one ordered set of pages that the ordinary
    test command executes: `walkthrough/NN-<slug>.md`, run by pytest with
    `--doctest-glob=*.md`. The example a reader reads is the example that ran.
    Do not write a second copy of a behaviour beside the code — no prose example
    that is not executed, no screenshot that is not a byproduct of a test
    asserting what the code did. What text cannot hold is emitted by that test
    and **recorded, never compared**: a test that diffs images fails on a font
    and gets switched off. Regeneration rides the command you already run before
    a pull request, so drift shows up as an uncommitted diff rather than as
    staleness nobody sees. A skip is not a pass, and a page that always skips is
    deleted.
14. **The workstation, the agent and the conversation are not the
    organisation** — record
    `governance/qm/records/DRAFT-what-is-not-the-organisation.md`, with
    `governance/qm/handbook/what-is-not-the-organisation.md` as the thing to
    do. A committed file states what is true of this project: not where a
    clone sits on one disk, which editor held it, what the tool driving a
    session did with its shell, or what anybody said. A decision enters as a
    decision, never as reported speech; a commit message describes the change
    and not the conversation behind it. The seed's `leak-check.yml` runs
    `check_leaks.py` on the mechanical part — a home path, a personal folder,
    a scratch path, a shared link; the rest is yours to read for before you
    push.
15. **Work is delivered into a repository, never to a hosted page** — record
    `governance/qm/records/DRAFT-work-is-delivered-into-a-repository.md`. A
    report, a demo, a preview or a handoff is a committed file, and reaches a
    reviewer as a pull request or as a page the reviewer builds and serves
    locally. Nothing goes to a page an assistant's host keeps outside the
    org's repositories, such as a chat product's shareable artifact or canvas:
    it is not versioned with the code, cannot be reviewed as a diff, and goes
    stale unseen. `check_leaks.py` refuses a committed link to one.
16. **A shared allowance is drawn on politely** — record
    `governance/qm/records/DRAFT-a-shared-allowance-is-drawn-on-politely.md`.
    Before many calls to one service, read what remains of its allowance and
    state the count; past a tenth, ask first. Sample for an estimate, keep each
    response as it arrives, send a few at a time, and stop at the first refusal
    that names a limit, saying when it resets. The allowance belongs to every
    caller on the credential.

## One-time setup on a fresh clone (Windows)

`CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` are real symlinks to this
file, not copies — POSIX checkouts resolve them with no setup. On Windows,
enable Developer Mode (Settings → For developers) and run `git config
core.symlinks true` once per clone, then `git checkout -- .` if the files
were already checked out before that; the checkout then resolves them as a
POSIX one does. Without that setting, each of the two checks out as a
one-line file holding the relative path to this file: a person can follow
it, and a tool that reads only that file gets the path rather than these
instructions. The IDE-integrated governance discovery record in
`governance/qm/records/` is the decision behind both files.

<!-- Project-specific setup commands, test commands, and conventions belong
     below this line. Above it, the governance section of
     governance/qm/project-seed/ide/AGENTS.md stays verbatim apart from the
     project's name. -->
